            The application right now has as a main goal show how can we mix the declarative power of rules, 
            business processes and complex event processing to create application that can be understood by 
            business people. The future of the application will be driven by the Drools and jBPM5 projects 
            that are continuously evolving. Ontologies, smart and distributed agents, more powerful domain 
            specific languages, predictive models and planning algorithms will be included as part of the 
            design of the application architecture to test and demonstrate how all these features can be 
            complemented to provide a more flexible platform to build applications.
