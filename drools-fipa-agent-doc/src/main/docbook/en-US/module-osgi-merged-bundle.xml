            The OSGI Merged Bundle is being used to create a single merged bundle containing ACL, CORE and UTILS under the 
            same bundle. This allow us to get a single bundle that can be deployed in any OSGI container to manage the 
            CORE, ACL and UTILS version to simplify the deployment.
